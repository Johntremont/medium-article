        <h2>Why Learn Ruby?</h2>
        <p>
            Ruby is a general purpose language that is still popular and in high 
            demand in the marketplace, as it is more commonly used in 
            Rails applications.

            Concise and readable, it is easy to pick up but also plenty 
            powerful. Companies like Twitter, Soundcloud, Goodreads, and 
            Kickstarter got their products off the ground with Ruby.

        <h2>Take-Away Skills:</h2>
        <p>
            In this course, you will gain familiarity with Ruby and basic programming concepts including variables, loops, control 
            flow, and most importantly, object-oriented programming. You will get a chance to test your understanding in a final 
            project, which you will build locally.

        <h2>Why Learn Ruby on Rails?</h2>
        <p>
            Build 8 full fledged web applications with Rails, one of the most popular and easy to use web application development 
            frameworks. By the end of the course, you will be familiar with Rails core concepts, like the MVC design pattern, and 
            how to communicate with databases to persist data. Rails is a Ruby based framework, and builds off knowledge from the 
            Ruby course.
